# 😊 What Makes You Happy? – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict factors that influence human happiness using Machine Learning techniques. By exploring survey-based data, the model identifies key attributes that contribute to an individual’s happiness level and provides meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end ML workflow**, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.
